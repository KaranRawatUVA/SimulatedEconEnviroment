# SimulatedEconEnviroment
## Fed Sim Project V1
##### This is the first version of the Fed Sim.
##### There is only one right answer for the scenarios and it effects stability.
##### Future versions should have an updated UI and more free flowing econ variables, so there is more freedom

## Rules: 
##### Take the role of the Fed in the US economy!
##### Get a scenario every fiscal quarter that effects the stability of the country.
##### You have a chance to react to each scenario with one of nine options!
##### Make it to 2033 or get fired if stability reaches below 0!
